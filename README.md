# just games!

what the title says. it's more coding practice, and i get to play games i made. win-win!

i love svelte

## what games do u have?

like _nothing right now_

but i do have some that will kick this off though:

- chess
- mastermind
- minesweeper
- snake
- sudoku
- wordle

yeah and i'll add as i go

man i should really get to that trello page soon

## installation

1. clone the repo
2. and run it!

ok i'll explain

### 1. clone the repo

`git clone developer-ramen/just-games`
or in case ur bougie and have `gh` cli:
`gh repo clone developer-ramen/just-games`

### 2. and run it!

`npm` is a REQUIREMENT for this project. i dont care if u dont have it, google `install npm`. i'll wait.

`cd just-games`
`npm run dev -- --open` to develop, or `npm run build` to build and `npm run preview` to actually see the page

## how do i play?

like just click on the website and play?

i dunno i haven't thought about how to add instructions to the games yet

## Why are you talking in all lowercase?

i dunno i just like it stop pestering me about it
